# PictureBar

A [Processing](http://processing.org/) class file to help making bar charts
with icons instead of plain color.

See the images in the screen_shots folder as an example.

## Description of Examples

The data is taken from the [Firefox Test Pilot survey](https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/beta/aggregated-data.html).
This survey was voluntarily submitted by some people beta testing Firefox 4.
The bar charts show what is the fraction of users who use a different browser
as their primary browser and, yet, are beta testing Firefox 4.

These charts were intended to serve only as examples.
